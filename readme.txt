rickdiff 

rickdiff is a personal project that I use extensively at work.  It is basically a command-line launcher for Meld (meldmerge.org) that supports CVS and the directory structure I use while working, where each CVS sandbox is under a root directory.  It's very flexible and powerful but probably isn't generally useful, mostly since it only supports CVS since that's what the projects I work on use.  I'd love to add Subversion and git support, but that probably won't be happening any time soon.
