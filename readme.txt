rickdiff

rickdiff is a personal project that I use extensively at work.  It is basically
a command-line launcher for Meld (meldmerge.org) that supports CVS and the
directory structure I use while working, where each CVS sandbox is under a root
directory.

It's very flexible and powerful but probably isn't generally useful, mostly
since it only supports CVS since that's what the projects I work on use.  I'd
love to add Subversion and git support, but that probably won't be happening
any time soon.

I don't expect this to be generally useful for people, but want to store it in
version control for my own use.

***FLASH***

9/23/2015 - Now that we are _finally_ switching to git, I will be implementing
git support in the near future.
